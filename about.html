  <h2>Our Story</h2>

  <div class="our-story">


    <p>In 2022, we started Astro Retreat, an organization designed to meet the demands of a much needed space expansion
      for mankind. Inspired by the previous pushes of NASA and SpaceX in the 20th and 21st centuries, we decieded to
      manufacture our own technologies for space travel. In 2025 we patented Beam thrusters, which reach 6.25 million
      km/h via Ions and the mimicing of protons. With these developments in mind, we worked out the logistics of space
      transport. 2030 saw our first space hub for travelers, such as an airport. 250 Finally, we created our first
      proto-settlement on the Moon</p>

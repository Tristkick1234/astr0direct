  <h2>Our Story</h2>

  <div class="our-story">


    <p>In 2022, we started Astro Retreat, an organization designed to meet the demands of a much needed space expansion
      for mankind. Inspired by the previous pushes of NASA and SpaceX in the 20th and 21st centuries, we decieded to
      manufacture our own technologies and lay the foundation for space tourism. </p>


    
  </div>

  <h2>Our mission</h2>
  <div class="our-mission">
    <p>Our mission is to expand space exploration and close in on the final frontier. To do this, we orbit Astro Hubs around planets in our Solar system for easy accessibility. We envision a solar system as our neighborhood, in which we lay the foundation of the structure of humanity. Our space tourism experience will enrichen and enlighten human kind. </p>

        <h2>2017</h2>
        <p>We patented Beam thrusters, allowing speeds of mph via the cloning of photons. We then combined its use with solar sails for faster speeds of 500k mph. Several other designs were tested and implemented such as the Odysseus, the Elytron, and Mercure I.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item-right">
        <h2>2019</h2>
        <p>First Astro Hub launched to orbit around the Earth. Eventually replaced the ISS because of its comfort and practicality. Experimentation with Cryosleep began for clients on longer trips</p>
